# Discord Bot - Stable Diffusion AMD

This Discord bot, named "Stable Diffusion AMD," is designed to generate images based on user prompts using deep learning models. It utilizes the `discord.py` library and integrates with Hugging Face's model repository for image generation.



## System Requirements
+ Python 3.7 , 3.8 , 3.9 or 3.10 (https://www.python.org/)

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

| Nvidia GPU  | :x: |
| AMD CPU |:white_check_mark: |
| Intel CPU |‚ùì |

## Features

- Generate images based on user-provided prompts.
- Utilize a variety of deep learning models for image generation.
- Interact with images through reactions for regenerating them.
- Check for bot updates using a version comparison mechanism.

## Commands

- `-creatimg [prompt]`: Add an image generation request to the queue.
- `-load_model [model_name]`: Load a specific deep learning model for image generation.
- `-download_model [model_name]`: Download a model from Hugging Face's model repository.
- Reaction "üîÑ": Regenerate an image based on the original prompt.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SimolZimol/Discord-Bot-stable-diffusion-AMD.git`
2. Configure the `TOKEN` and `token_huggingface` variables in the `bot.py` file.
